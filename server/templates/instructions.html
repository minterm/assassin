		<h2>What do I need?</h2>
		<p>To play this game, all you need is an Android phone with
           Bluetooth, GPS, an Internet connection, and some friends.</p>

		<h2>Gameplay Recommendations</h2>
		<p>
        Start by creating a <a href="/new">new</a> game. Enter in the names
        of all the players. Once the game has been created, all players must 
        open the Android app on their phones and join the game, using their 
        names and the game ID shown on the web page. Now the game has been 
        created.
        </p>
        <p>
        Inside the app, ensure that each phone has Bluetooth turned on and 
        discovery enabled. Displayed at the top is their target's Bluetooth MAC
        address. When they are in range of their target, the assassinate button
        will be used to attempt to assassinate the target. Deaths are updated 
        automatically at 20 second intervals, and new targets are acquired 
        after each assassination. Locations are also periodically 
        updated. Do you have what it takes to be the last one standing?
